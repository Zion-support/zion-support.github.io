## Subject Line Options (A/B test 2–3 variants)

| Variant | Subject | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| A (primary) | Your engineering team is spending 30% of its time on toil |
| B | Autonomous agents that cut ops cost — not add another tool |
| C | Hermes Agent Platform: 5 ways to reduce operational costs |
| D | Quick question about your DevOps and code review workflow |

**Recommendation:** Test A (pain-first) vs. B (benefits-first) at launch. C and D are fallbacks.

## Email Body (Plain Text)

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I'll keep this short — you're busy.

Mid-market engineering teams I talk to are running into the same four problems:

1. **Code review is a bottleneck.** Senior engineers spend hours on PRs that a trained agent could flag for security, performance, and style in minutes — with auto-suggested patches.
2. **Deployments are still scary.** Even with CI/CD, someone is manually watching error rates, re-running flaky tests, and scrambling when a rollout goes sideways.
3. **Multi-step workflows are glue code.** Incident triage → root-cause → mitigation → postmortem is usually a chain of scripts, runbooks, and hero moments. It shouldn't be.
4. **Ops costs keep climbing.** Cloud spend, tooling sprawl, and manual incident response add up — and most teams only see the bill at the end of the month.

Zion Tech Group just launched the **Hermes Agent Platform** — a set of autonomous AI agent services that plug into the workflows above and run them with guardrails, human-in-the-loop escalation, and full observability.

Here's what the platform covers:

- **Autonomous Code Review Agent** — Static analysis + LLM reasoning across JS/TS, Python, and Go. CWE/OWASP scoring, auto-suggested diffs, custom rule engines, CI/CD integration. ($149–$1,499/mo)
- **Autonomous Code Deployment Agent** — Code-review finder, SAST/DAST security scans (CodeQL + Snyk + Trivy), auto-retry flaky tests up to 3x, feature-flag gates on green CI, automatic rollback on error-rate spike, Slack/Teams notification on completion. ($149–$1,499/mo)
- **AI Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform** — Visual workflow builder, agent-to-agent communication, automatic task decomposition, result aggregation/consensus, real-time monitoring. Deploy fleets of agents that collaborate on complex tasks. ($999–Custom/mo)
- **AI Agent Orchestrator** — Production-grade multi-agent management: workflow definition, guardrail enforcement, real-time observability, human-in-the-loop escalation, performance analytics and benchmarking. Scale from 10 to 10,000 agents. ($14,997–$34,997/mo)
- **AI Agents & Autonomous Workflows** — Reasoning & planning agents with tool/API integration, multi-step task execution, memory and context, human-in-the-loop controls for enterprise automation. ($149–$1,499/mo)

We also wrote a short lead magnet that maps these to actual cost categories:

**5 Ways Autonomous AI Agents Reduce Operational Costs** — covers headcount avoided, incident-to-resolution time, cloud waste, tool consolidation, and deployment failure cost. [Download it here → INSERT LEAD MAGNET URL]

This isn't another dashboard or observability tool you'll log into twice. These are agents that execute tasks — review code, gate deployments, orchestrate multi-step workflows, and escalate when they need a human.

If any of the four problems above sound familiar, I'd welcome 15 minutes to walk through which agents map to your stack. No deck, no generic pitch — just a concrete look at where the leverage is.

**Or browse the platform first:** https://ziontechgroup.com/services

If now isn't a good time, just say "not now" and I'll circle back in a quarter.

Best,

P.S. The lead magnet (5 Ways Autonomous AI Agents Reduce Operational Costs) is a self-contained PDF — no gate, no form. Worth a look even if we never talk.

## Follow-Up Cadence

| Touch | Timing | Goal | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| Email 1 (above) | Day 0 | Introduce platform, surface pain, offer lead magnet + call | Single send; no follow-up if reply received |
| Email 2 | Day 3 | Re-engage with specific service + social proof | References Autonomous Code Review Agent + Code Deployment Agent; shorter |
| Email 3 | Day 7 | Last touch, value-add, soft close | References the lead magnet and Orchestration/Orchestrator services; offers to send a pilot scope doc |

## Personalization Tokens

| Token | Source | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| [FIRST_NAME] | Prospect first name | "Hi Sarah," |
| [COMPANY] | Prospect company | "at Acme Corp" |
| [TEAM_SIZE] | Estimated eng team size | "a 120-person eng team" |
| [STACK_HINT] | Known tech stack (if available) | "your React/Node service" |
| [RECENT_NEWS] | Company news / funding / hiring | "your Series B" |

**Usage notes:**
- Always use at least [FIRST_NAME].
- Use [COMPANY] in the opening line if known.
- Use [TEAM_SIZE] to qualify urgency ("a 30-person team can absorb this differently than a 200-person team").
- Use [STACK_HINT] only when confirmed — never guess.
- Use [RECENT_NEWS] sparingly — one specific, verifiable reference per email max.
