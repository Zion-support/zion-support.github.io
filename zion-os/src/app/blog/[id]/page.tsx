      'Enterprises are embracing autonomous agents to accelerate operations, but governance must evolve to keep pace. This blueprint provides a pragmatic structure to deploy safe autonomy without stifling innovation.',
      'We recommend a layered control model: preventative policy (what is allowed), detective monitoring (what actually happened), and corrective actions (how we recover). Each layer is measurable and testable.',
      'Key capabilities include: role- and risk-based permissions, human-in-the-loop for sensitive actions, red-team simulation, tamper-evident logs, and post-incident learning loops.',
      'Adopt in phases: start with policy catalogs and identity, instrument critical actions with approvals, then automate low-risk actions and continuously raise autonomy confidence as evidence accumulates.'

      'Sovereign AI commerce represents the convergence of autonomous decision systems, verifiable identity, and programmable markets. With Zion OS, organizations can deploy marketplaces that self-orchestrate supply, demand, and policy without central bottlenecks.',
      'In this guide, we outline a phased approach: start with identity and governance, introduce autonomous listing and matching, then activate treasury and incentive policies. Each phase is measurable and reversible, ensuring safe rollout.',
      'Key building blocks include: DID-backed identity, reputation scoring, policy engines, event-driven orchestration, and human-in-the-loop controls for sensitive actions.',
      'Outcomes: reduced operational cost, higher market liquidity, and more resilient ecosystems that adapt in real time to participant behavior and external signals.'
