# Zion App - AI-Driven Continuous Improvement System

This system automatically delegates AI-powered improvements across multiple computers with Cursor installed, providing intelligent, continuous enhancement of your application.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Computer Coordination**: Distribute AI tasks across multiple machines
- **Intelligent Task Delegation**: Automatically assign tasks based on node capabilities and load
- **Cursor AI Integration**: Leverage Cursor AI for code analysis and improvements
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of code quality, performance, and security
- **Automated Improvements**: Apply AI-suggested improvements automatically
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs and reports for all activities

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **AI Continuous Improvement System** (`ai-continuous-improvement.cjs`)
   - Monitors code quality, performance, security, and user experience
   - Generates AI suggestions for improvements
   - Applies improvements automatically

2. **Cursor AI Delegator** (`cursor-ai-delegator.cjs`)
   - Manages AI task distribution across multiple computers
   - Handles Cursor API integration
   - Processes and prioritizes improvement tasks

3. **Multi-Computer Coordinator** (`multi-computer-coordinator.cjs`)
   - Coordinates communication between nodes
   - Manages shared storage and task distribution
   - Handles node discovery and health monitoring

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed on all computers
- Cursor installed on all computers
