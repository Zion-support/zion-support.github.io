## Environment Configuration

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **Supabase for authentication** and **Netlify for environment variable management**. Proper configuration is essential for the application to function correctly.

### Authentication Setup

The application uses Supabase for all authentication functionality:
- User registration and login
- Email verification and password reset
- Social authentication (Google, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter)
- Session management and profile handling

### Required Environment Variables

A comprehensive list of environment variables can be found in the `.env.example` file. For local development, copy this file to `.env.local` and populate it with the necessary values. **Do not commit `.env.local` to version control.**

For production deployments, all variables are configured directly in Netlify's UI, so the repository no longer contains a `.env.local` file with secrets.

**Key variables include:**

-   **Supabase Configuration:**
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    -   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for server-side operations)
-   **NextAuth.js Configuration:**
    -   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (a randomly generated string for signing tokens)
    -   `NEXTAUTH_URL` (the canonical URL of your application)
-   **OAuth Provider Credentials:**
    -   `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
    -   `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` & `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`
    -   `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
    -   `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` & `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` (and potentially `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`)
    -   Other provider credentials as needed.
-   **Internal Authentication Service:**
    -   `INTERNAL_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` (if used for specific flows like registration)

Ensure all variables marked as required in `.env.example` or in specific documentation (like `docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md`) are correctly set.

### 📚 Detailed Setup Guides

- **[Supabase Authentication Setup](docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md)** - Complete guide for configuring Supabase authentication
- **[Netlify Deployment Guide](docs/NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Step-by-step Netlify deployment with environment variables
- **[Optional Two-Factor Authentication](TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Overview of enabling 2FA in the IPO portal
- **[Logging Guidelines](docs/LOGGING_GUIDELINES.md)** - Usage instructions for the project logger
- **Collect Logs** - `npm run logs:collect` bundles recent logs under `logs/archive/`
- **Analyze Logs** - `npm run logs:summary` scans collected `.log` and `.txt` files, reports missing translation keys, and flags router context errors like `useNavigate()` without a `<Router>`
- **Improved Analysis** - The log analyzer now highlights TypeScript compilation issues such as `Cannot find name` errors
- **Health Check** - `npm run logs:health` prints a quick system status report
- You can skip external connectivity tests by setting `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_CHECKS=true` when running
  the health check (useful for offline environments)
- **Health Summary** - `npm run logs:health:summary` writes a detailed report to `logs/health-summary.json`
  including an overall project grade
- **Missing Key Log** - Any translation keys not found at runtime are appended to `logs/missing-keys.log`
- **Check for Missing Translations** - `npm run i18n:missing` verifies that all locales contain the same translation keys

### CDN for Static Assets

To improve performance, the application can serve static assets from a CDN.
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL` to your CDN domain (e.g., `https://cdn.yourdomain.com`).
When this variable is provided in production builds, Next.js will prefix asset
URLs so they are loaded from the CDN.

### Quick Setup Verification

After setting up environment variables, verify your configuration:

```bash
# Check environment setup
npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/check-env.ts

# Test Supabase connection (in browser console)
console.log('Supabase configured:', !!window.location.origin.includes('localhost') || !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
```

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Node.js (v20+), npm, Python, pip, Docker (recommended).

2.  **Clone the repository.**

3.  **Install project dependencies:** Run the setup script with your preferred
    package manager. Example:
    - `./setup.sh npm` *(default)*
    - `./setup.sh pnpm`
    - `./setup.sh yarn`
    - `./setup.sh bun`
    Ensure you have internet connectivity so dependencies can be downloaded.

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    - For **local development**: Create `.env.local` based on environment variable requirements above
    - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID` to your Reown AppKit project ID (see `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SAFEGUARDS.md`)
    - For **production**: Set variables in Netlify UI (see deployment guide)
    - Ensure `INTERNAL_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` points to your authentication service
    - **Enable DevTools**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVTOOLS=true` in `.env.local` if you want browser DevTools enabled
    - **Validate configuration**: Run `npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/check-env.ts`

5.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    - **Django backend**: Refer to `backend/README.md` or run `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
    - **Monitoring service**: `cd monitoring && npm install`

6.  **Database Setup:**
    - Run Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
    - Seed data: `npx prisma db seed`
    - Set up Django database (see backend documentation)

7.  **Running the application:**
    - **Next.js frontend**: `npm run dev` *(automatically validates your development environment)*
    - **Django backend**: `python backend/manage.py runserver`
    - **Node.js server**: `node server/index.cjs` (or via npm script)

8.  **Verify authentication setup:**
    - Test user registration at `/auth/register`
    - Test login at `/auth/login`
    - Verify email verification flow

9.  **Cleaning caches and logs:**
    - Run `npm run clean:cache` to remove temporary log files and common build caches.
    - Regenerate the sitemap with `npm run sitemap` whenever routes change.
    - Fix any accidental `react-router` links by running `node scripts/fix-link-hrefs.cjs`.

10. **Generate Press Kit Archive:**
    - The downloadable press kit is not stored in the repository.
    - Run `npm run build:media-kit` to create `public/toolkit_assets/media_kit.zip`.

11. **Payment Testing:**
    - **Enable Test Mode:** Ensure `STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for backend) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for frontend) are set in your environment (e.g., `.env.local` or CI/staging environment variables). This forces the application to use Stripe test API keys.
    - **Test Card:** Use the generic Stripe test card:
        - Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
        - Expiration Date: Any future date (e.g., 12/30)
        - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
    - **View Transactions:** Test transactions can be viewed in your Stripe Dashboard (ensure "View test data" is enabled).
    - **Demo Products:** If no products appear, run `npm run seed` to populate demo products.
    - **Guest Checkout:** Available at `/marketplace` (add items to cart and proceed to checkout).
    - **Sandbox Login:** For authenticated flows, use development credentials from `.env.local` as described in `docs/SECURITY_CREDENTIALS.md`.
    - **Full Details:** For a comprehensive list of test cards and scenarios, see the detailed guide in **[docs/Payments.md](docs/Payments.md)**.

11. **Contract Tests:**
    - Pact-based contract tests verify that front-end routes match available API endpoints.
    - Start the stub server with `node server/stubServer.js` and run `npm test`.

12. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
    - Set `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
    - Run `npm run test:browserstack` to execute Playwright tests on BrowserStack across desktop and mobile browsers.

13. **Local Cypress Testing:**
    - Copy `cypress.env.example.json` to `cypress.env.json`.
    - Adjust the placeholder values with your test credentials.
    - This prevents "EXISTING_USER_EMAIL" and similar errors during `npm run test:e2e`.

13. **Privacy Policy & Terms (login-gated):**
    - AI-Prompt: "Generate a plain-language summary (≤ 200 words) of a standard tech marketplace privacy policy aimed at U.S. users."
    - AI-Prompt: "Write an FAQ with 5 common questions users ask about Zion's Terms of Service."
13. **Frequently Asked Questions:** See [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) or the in-app Help Center for quick answers.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Supabase not configured" warnings**
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set with actual values (not placeholders)
   - Check variable names for typos

2. **Authentication failures**
   - Verify Supabase project is properly configured
   - Check that email authentication is enabled in Supabase dashboard
   - Ensure redirect URLs are configured correctly

3. **Build failures on Netlify**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set in Netlify UI
   - Check build logs for specific TypeScript or dependency errors
4. **Blank screen when starting the app**
   - Ensure dependencies are installed by running `./setup.sh npm`
   - Run `npm run fix:loading` to diagnose and apply the emergency loader
   - A fail-safe message will now appear if the page stays blank for a few seconds
   - Detection logic improved to catch cases where only stylesheets or scripts are rendered
   - See [docs/BLANK_SCREEN_FIX_GUIDE.md](docs/BLANK_SCREEN_FIX_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions
5. **Playwright browsers missing**
   - If end-to-end tests fail with `browserType.launch` errors, run `npx playwright install` to download the required browsers

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Supabase Authentication Setup Guide](docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md).

## 🚀 Performance & Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
- **Server Response Time**: ~2.6s (initial compilation) → ~83ms (cached)
- **Image Optimization**: ~10ms response time with WebP/AVIF support
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with chunk splitting and tree shaking
- **Build Time**: Improved with selective experimental features

### Health Checks
Run comprehensive performance and health checks:

```bash
# Full performance audit
npm run perf:monitor

# Environment validation
npm run env:dev

# Bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze
```

### Key Optimizations Applied
1. **Image Optimization**: Fixed 400 errors, added comprehensive domain support
2. **Webpack Configuration**: Optimized chunking, reduced serialization warnings
3. **Sentry Integration**: Conditional loading, graceful fallbacks
4. **Environment Handling**: Enhanced validation, placeholder detection
5. **CSS Optimization**: Production-only to avoid development conflicts
6. **Error Handling**: Improved user experience, reduced console spam

### Monitoring Dashboard
The application includes built-in monitoring for:
- Server health and response times
- Image optimization performance
- File system integrity
- Environment configuration validation
- Error reporting and analytics

### Troubleshooting Blank Screens
If the application loads with a completely empty page, it usually means
the required `node_modules` directory is missing. Check `next_dev_server.log`
for errors and reinstall dependencies:

If the app logs **"Error loading tenant"** during startup, the request to the
Supabase edge function that provides whitelabel settings failed. Confirm that
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in your environment and
that you have network connectivity. The tenant hook will retry a few times
before giving up.

## Testing

Run unit tests with:

```sh
npm run test
```

To watch tests during development:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

### End-to-End Tests

Open Cypress for interactive debugging:

```sh
npm run cypress:open
```

Run the Cypress suite headlessly:

```sh
npm run cypress:run
```
