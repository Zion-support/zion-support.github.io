2. ✅ Build should now succeed
3. ✅ Missing files will be auto-created

### Short-term (Next Week)
1. Monitor first automated build success
2. Review dependency update PR
3. Verify security vulnerability fixes

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Monitor build success rates
2. Review performance improvements
3. Optimize based on metrics

### Long-term (Ongoing)
