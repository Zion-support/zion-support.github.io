# Project Title (Example - To Be Updated)

This is the main README for the project. Below are details about specific components and utilities.

## URL Performance Monitoring

This project includes a URL/API performance monitoring service located in the `monitoring/` directory. It periodically checks configured endpoints, logs their performance, and can trigger alerts and custom remediation actions if performance degrades. For detailed information, see the [`monitoring/README.md`](./monitoring/README.md) file.

- **Frontend Application (Next.js):** Located primarily in `src/` (for application code like components, hooks, pages using App Router) and `pages/` (for API routes and potentially older Pages Router content). This is the main user-facing application.
- **Backend API (Django):** Located in `backend/`. This Python-based backend serves core business logic and data management, likely interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Node.js Backend Services:**
  - **`server/`:** An Express.js application that provides additional API endpoints, potentially for specific features, BFF patterns, or integration tasks. It connects to MongoDB.
  - **`api/` (within `pages/api/` or `src/pages/api`):** Next.js API routes providing serverless backend functionality directly within the Next.js application.
- **Monitoring Service:** Located in `monitoring/`. A Node.js service for monitoring URL performance and health. (See `monitoring/README.md` for details).
- **Supabase Integration:** Utilizes Supabase for backend-as-a-service features, with functions in `supabase/functions/` and schema definitions in `prisma/` (Prisma is used with Supabase, and potentially also for the Django backend or other Node.js services).
- **Blockchain/DAO Components:** Directories like `dao/` and `token/` suggest features related to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and cryptocurrency tokens.
- **SDK:** A software development kit is present in `sdk/`, likely for interacting with Zion platform services.
- **Documentation:** General documentation is in `docs/`, with specific component documentation potentially within their respective directories.
- **Testing:** Extensive test suites using Vitest and Cypress are in `tests/` and `cypress/`. See **[docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](docs/QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)** for common QA steps.
- **Connect Portal:** Access the portal at `/portal` for account management and settings. The previous `/app` path is deprecated.

## Set environment variables (optional):
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust any values needed for your setup.
Important variables include:
* `DJANGO_API_BASE_URL`, `NEXTJS_API_BASE_URL`, `CUSTOM_SERVER_BASE_URL` –
  base URLs for services you want to monitor (used by the `monitoring/` service).
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` – credentials required for Supabase
  authentication (used for login).
* `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` – a webhook endpoint (Slack, Discord, etc.) for alert
  notifications (used by the `monitoring/` service).
* `LOG_LEVEL` – logging verbosity (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`).

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Chakra UI, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend (Django):** Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL
- **Backend (Node.js):** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB (for `server/`), Next.js API Routes
- **Database/BaaS:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, Prisma
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (handles login, signup, password reset, social auth) with optional two-factor authentication for the IPO portal
- **Monitoring:** Custom Node.js service, Sentry, Datadog
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Netlify (including Lighthouse CI)
- **Other:** IPFS, OrbitDB, Ethers.js, Elasticsearch

## Running Tests

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **Supabase for authentication** and **Netlify for environment variable management**. Proper configuration is essential for the application to function correctly.

### Authentication Setup

The application uses Supabase for all authentication functionality:

- User registration and login
- Email verification and password reset
- Social authentication (Google, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter)
- Session management and profile handling

### Required Environment Variables

A comprehensive list of environment variables can be found in the `.env.example` file. For local development, copy this file to `.env.local` and populate it with the necessary values. **Do not commit `.env.local` to version control.**

For production deployments, all variables are configured directly in Netlify's UI, so the repository no longer contains a `.env.local` file with secrets.

**Key variables include:**

- **Supabase Configuration:**
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (for server-side operations)
- **NextAuth.js Configuration:**
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (a randomly generated string for signing tokens)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (the canonical URL of your application)
- **OAuth Provider Credentials:**
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID` & `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` & `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` (and potentially `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`)
  - Other provider credentials as needed.
- **Internal Authentication Service:**
  - `INTERNAL_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` (if used for specific flows like registration)

Ensure all variables marked as required in `.env.example` or in specific documentation (like `docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md`) are correctly set.

### 📚 Detailed Setup Guides

- **[Supabase Authentication Setup](docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md)** - Complete guide for configuring Supabase authentication
- **[Netlify Deployment Guide](docs/NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Step-by-step Netlify deployment with environment variables
- **[Optional Two-Factor Authentication](TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Overview of enabling 2FA in the IPO portal
- **[Logging Guidelines](docs/LOGGING_GUIDELINES.md)** - Usage instructions for the project logger
- **Collect Logs** - `npm run logs:collect` bundles recent logs under `logs/archive/`
- **Analyze Logs** - `npm run logs:summary` scans collected `.log` and `.txt` files, reports missing translation keys, and flags router context errors like `useNavigate()` without a `<Router>`
- **Improved Analysis** - The log analyzer now highlights TypeScript compilation issues such as `Cannot find name` errors
- **Health Check** - `npm run logs:health` prints a quick system status report
- You can skip external connectivity tests by setting `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_CHECKS=true` when running
  the health check (useful for offline environments)
- **Health Summary** - `npm run logs:health:summary` writes a detailed report to `logs/health-summary.json`
  including an overall project grade
- **Missing Key Log** - Any translation keys not found at runtime are appended to `logs/missing-keys.log`
- **Check for Missing Translations** - `npm run i18n:missing` verifies that all locales contain the same translation keys

### CDN for Static Assets

To improve performance, the application can serve static assets from a CDN.
Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL` to your CDN domain (e.g., `https://cdn.yourdomain.com`).
When this variable is provided in production builds, Next.js will prefix asset
URLs so they are loaded from the CDN.

### Quick Setup Verification

After setting up environment variables, verify your configuration:

```bash
# Production build
npm run build:ci

# Test Supabase connection (in browser console)
console.log('Supabase configured:', !!window.location.origin.includes('localhost') || !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
```

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Node.js (v20+), npm, Python, pip, Docker (recommended).

2.  **Clone the repository.**

3.  **Install project dependencies:** Run the setup script with your preferred
    package manager. Example:

    - `./setup.sh npm` _(default)_
    - `./setup.sh pnpm`
    - `./setup.sh yarn`
    - `./setup.sh bun`
      Ensure you have internet connectivity so dependencies can be downloaded.

4.  **Configure environment variables:**

    - For **local development**: Create `.env.local` based on environment variable requirements above
    - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_REOWN_PROJECT_ID` to your Reown AppKit project ID (see `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SAFEGUARDS.md`)
    - For **production**: Set variables in Netlify UI (see deployment guide)
    - Ensure `INTERNAL_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` points to your authentication service
    - **Enable DevTools**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVTOOLS=true` in `.env.local` if you want browser DevTools enabled
    - **Validate configuration**: Run `npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/check-env.ts`

5.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    - **Django backend**: Refer to `backend/README.md` or run `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
    - **Monitoring service**: `cd monitoring && npm install`

6.  **Database Setup:**

    - Run Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
    - Seed data: `npx prisma db seed`
    - Set up Django database (see backend documentation)

7.  **Running the application:**

    - **Next.js frontend**: `npm run dev` _(automatically validates your development environment)_
    - **Django backend**: `python backend/manage.py runserver`
    - **Node.js server**: `node server/index.cjs` (or via npm script)

8.  **Verify authentication setup:**

    - Test user registration at `/auth/register`
    - Test login at `/auth/login`
    - Verify email verification flow

9.  **Cleaning caches and logs:**

    - Run `npm run clean:cache` to remove temporary log files and common build caches.
    - Regenerate the sitemap with `npm run sitemap` whenever routes change.
    - Fix any accidental `react-router` links by running `node scripts/fix-link-hrefs.cjs`.

10. **Generate Press Kit Archive:**

    - The downloadable press kit is not stored in the repository.
    - Run `npm run build:media-kit` to create `public/toolkit_assets/media_kit.zip`.

11. **Payment Testing:**

    - **Enable Test Mode:** Ensure `STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for backend) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` (for frontend) are set in your environment (e.g., `.env.local` or CI/staging environment variables). This forces the application to use Stripe test API keys.
    - **Test Card:** Use the generic Stripe test card:
      - Card Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
      - Expiration Date: Any future date (e.g., 12/30)
      - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
    - **View Transactions:** Test transactions can be viewed in your Stripe Dashboard (ensure "View test data" is enabled).
    - **Demo Products:** If no products appear, run `npm run seed` to populate demo products.
    - **Guest Checkout:** Available at `/marketplace` (add items to cart and proceed to checkout).
    - **Sandbox Login:** For authenticated flows, use development credentials from `.env.local` as described in `docs/SECURITY_CREDENTIALS.md`.
    - **Full Details:** For a comprehensive list of test cards and scenarios, see the detailed guide in **[docs/Payments.md](docs/Payments.md)**.

12. **Contract Tests:**

    - Pact-based contract tests verify that front-end routes match available API endpoints.
    - Start the stub server with `node server/stubServer.js` and run `npm test`.

13. **Cross-Browser Testing:**

    - Set `BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
    - Run `npm run test:browserstack` to execute Playwright tests on BrowserStack across desktop and mobile browsers.

14. **Local Cypress Testing:**

    - Copy `cypress.env.example.json` to `cypress.env.json`.
    - Adjust the placeholder values with your test credentials.
    - This prevents "EXISTING_USER_EMAIL" and similar errors during `npm run test:e2e`.

15. **Privacy Policy & Terms (login-gated):**
    - AI-Prompt: "Generate a plain-language summary (≤ 200 words) of a standard tech marketplace privacy policy aimed at U.S. users."
    - AI-Prompt: "Write an FAQ with 5 common questions users ask about Zion's Terms of Service."
16. **Frequently Asked Questions:** See [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) or the in-app Help Center for quick answers.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Supabase not configured" warnings**

   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set with actual values (not placeholders)
   - Check variable names for typos

2. **Authentication failures**

   - Verify Supabase project is properly configured
   - Check that email authentication is enabled in Supabase dashboard
   - Ensure redirect URLs are configured correctly

3. **Build failures on Netlify**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set in Netlify UI
   - Check build logs for specific TypeScript or dependency errors
4. **Blank screen when starting the app**
   - Ensure dependencies are installed by running `./setup.sh npm`
   - Run `npm run fix:loading` to diagnose and apply the emergency loader
   - A fail-safe message will now appear if the page stays blank for a few seconds
   - Detection logic improved to catch cases where only stylesheets or scripts are rendered
   - See [docs/BLANK_SCREEN_FIX_GUIDE.md](docs/BLANK_SCREEN_FIX_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Supabase Authentication Setup Guide](docs/SUPABASE_AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md).
